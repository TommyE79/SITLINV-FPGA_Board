PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/wrPtrFull/wDirSet is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/wrPtrFull/rDir_i_1/O, cell inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/wrPtrFull/rDir_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/txPort/gate/fifo/wrPtrFull/wDirSet is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/txPort/gate/fifo/wrPtrFull/rDir_i_1__0/O, cell inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/txPort/gate/fifo/wrPtrFull/rDir_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1839#20 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/mem/rRAM_reg_0 has an input control pin inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/mem/rRAM_reg_0/ADDRBWRADDR[9] (net: inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/mem/rRAM_reg_1_3[4]) which is driven by a register (inst_gvi_pcie/pcie_wrapper/app/endpoint/endpoint64.endpoint/channels[0].channel/rxPort/mainFifo/fifo/rdPtrEmpty/rRdPtr_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
