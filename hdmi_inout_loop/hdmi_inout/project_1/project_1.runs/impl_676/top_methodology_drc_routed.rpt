CKBF-1#1 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFG cell dvi2rgb_m0/GenerateBUFG.ResyncToBUFG_X/InstBUFG I pin is driven by a BUFR cell dvi2rgb_m0/TMDS_ClockingX/PixelClkBuffer. For 7-Series devices, this is not a recommended clock topology. Please analyze your clock network and remove the BUFR to BUFG cascade.

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
