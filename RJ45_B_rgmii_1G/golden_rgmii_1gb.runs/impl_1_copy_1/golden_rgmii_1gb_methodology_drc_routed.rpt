2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT gmii_to_rgmii_inst0/bufmr_rgmii_rxc_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) e_mdio direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (e_mdio) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
